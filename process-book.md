# Process book

[Markdown version (recommended)](https://github.com/com-480-data-visualization/data-visualization-project-2021-datavizards/blob/master/process-book.md) | [PDF version](https://github.com/com-480-data-visualization/data-visualization-project-2021-datavizards/blob/master/process-book.pdf)

## Brainstorm

* Start with the end result, and "how did we arrive here"?
* Add an image for the process book intro (even a stock image with our website under it, to make a nice first impression)
* Picking the topic (how we decided to do this one, our fears about having not enough data, ...)
* Picking the right dataset(s) for the job
* How did we decide on the visualizations we did? (three separate brainstorms, and we put everything in common after a week. What you see now is a merge of the three things)
* Prototyping phase (include Kush's drawings, initial website)
* Getting ready: splitting the work (separate D3 components that we would merge together afterwards - talk about index.dev, new website))
* Talk about each D3 component on the website, who made them, what challenges did we have for those, and we solved them in the end... (if possible, use pictures/GIFs to explain those! -> Animations are always better than pictures)
* Have a section about main achievements/challenges to recap what we said (basically the conclusion)

## Who did what?

(TODO: Change, expand, or delete this sentence) We decided to split the work in independent tasks as early as we could.
