        Greetings fellow movie enthusiast!
      </p>

      <p class="text-center">
        Have you ever wondered what does it take to make a successful movie? Is it because the director's vision, the actor's performance
        or perhaps both? How does the actor-director's relationship influence the opinions of millions of viewers? You can answer these
        questions yourself through our interactive visualization! Before moving on to discover our constellation, please make sure to read
        the instructions for the best experience.

        INSTRUCTIONS: The constellation features director and actor nodes in distinct colors. You can hover over the nodes and links for

        transitions as well as details. You can click on a specific director-actor link for a detailed analysis. If you feel lost at any
        point, make sure to use the search bar at the top left, or simply zoom-in and out, and move around the space freely. You can use
