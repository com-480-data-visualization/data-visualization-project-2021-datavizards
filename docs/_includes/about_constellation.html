        Greetings fellow movie enthusiast! Have you ever wondered how does a movie become successful? Is it because of the
        director's vision, the actor's performance or perhaps both? Can the actor-director's relationship be what influences
        the opinions of millions of viewers? You can answer these questions yourself through our interactive visualization,
        designed as a part of the Data Visualization course at EPFL!
      </p>

      <p class="text-center">
        We believe that the relationship between an actor and a director might indicate an artistic understanding, a functional
        routine, or even a marketing strategy. These partnerships affect the outcomes of the movie industry, which can be studied
        using factors such as movie budget, gross revenue, IMDb rating and maybe more! We visualize this idea in the form of a
        network of nodes, which present the directors and actors, connected through links if they have worked together. Before
        moving on to discover our movie stars constellation, please  make sure to read the following instructions for the
        best experience.

        The constellation features director and actor nodes in distinct colors. You can hover on the nodes to check out the names
        clearly, and hover on the director-actor links to see the number of movies they have done together. You can (and should!)
        also hold and drag the nodes around for better clarity and beautiful transition effects. You can also look for your favourite
        actors and directors through the search bar on the top left of the constellation. Once you get the hang of it, you are ready
        to dive deeper and study the director-actor relationships. Click on any director-actor edge to check out the details about the
        success of the movies they have done together.
      </p>

        Feel free to use the visualization to observe and discover trends in the movie industry. Here are a few interesting
        ones that we found:
        1. Fact 1
        2. Fact 2
        3. Fact 3

        Disclaimer: If you are too lost in the constellation, make sure to zoom in, zoom out and move around the space freely. You canvas
        use the space outside the blue border to move away from the constellation to make sure you are not addicted to it. Have fun!
